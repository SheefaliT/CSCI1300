Maps (in Java)
===========

This is the homework assignment on associativate arrays. Java doesn't
have exactly what Python does, but it is close.

In Python we call these things called 'Dictionaries'. In Java, we call
them 'Map' objects. To use any object type (that isn't in `java.util`)
you need to `import` it first. A Java `Map` is merely an
interface---it defines the things a map can do, but it doesn't specify
how. To actually use a map, you need to use something that implements
the `Map` interface. We'll use `HashMap` in this example. To use
these, and the `List` interface with its associated `ArrayList`
implementation, use the following `import` statements at the top of
your file:


	import java.util.Map
	import java.util.HashMap
	import java.util.List
	import java.util.ArrayList

I'll leave the rest to you since we haven't done Java.
