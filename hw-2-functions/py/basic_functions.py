# Welcome to your first *real* programming assignment in CS 1300! This
# is all about functions. Read the README for this homework for
# higher-level info. Please fill out the above with your name, TA, and
# names of people with whom you worked.
#
# Remember: you should not change the name of any of these functions,
# because RetroGrade will expect them to be as-is.

#
# There are 'stubs' for several functions below. At the beginning,
# they all have 'pass' as their defining body. Your job is to replace
# 'pass' with some code that does whatever the function's
# documentation asks. 
#
# When you have written a function, try running the driver. Look in
# basic_functions_driver.py for more info.

def return_four():
    """
    This function returns the number 4.
    """
    pass

# 1 point
def add_numbers(first_number, second_number):
    """
    Return the sum of the two input values.
    """
    pass

# 1 point
def repeat_yourself(text, num_times):
    """
    Create and a return a string that is composed of the given text,
    repeated num_times. For example, if I use it like this:
    
    thrice = repeat_yourself("Sputnik", 3)

    ... the value of 'thrice' should be "SputnikSputnikSputnik".
    """
    pass

# 1 point
def add_one_to_all(numbers):
    """
    The input 'numbers' is a list of integers. Create and return
    another list whose contents are the same as 'numbers' but are one
    larger. For example, if I call this function with this list:

    [4, 8, 9, 0]

    ... add_one_to_all returns a list that looks like this:

    [5, 9, 10, 1]
    """
    pass

# 1 point
def is_odd(num):
    """
    Return True or False, depending on if the input number is odd.
    Odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. Even numbers are 0, 2, 4,
    6, and so on.
    """
    pass

def which_coin(cent_value):
    """
    The input 'cent_value' is a number representing the number of
    cents of a US coin. Make this function return a string
    representing which kind of coin it is. Valid inputs and outputs
    are as follows:

    1 ---- "Penny"
    5 ---- "Nickel"
    10 --- "Dime"
    25 --- "Quarter"

    Remember that computers think that strings like "penny" and
    "Penny" are different. Be sure you return EXACTLY the right
    spelling and capitalization.
    """
    pass

# 3 points
def get_primes_below(num):
    """
    Given an input number 'num', create a list that contains all the
    prime numbers that are smaller than it. Do not include 1 or the
    number itself in the output.

    A prime number is an integer that can be divided evenly only by
    one and itself.

    For example, if this is called with 24, the return list should be:

    [ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 ]

    Helpful hint: make a helper function called is_prime(num). That
    function should return True if the input number is prime or
    not. Then you can write a short (about five line) function here.

    Another helpful hint: Google is your friend.

    A parting helpful hint: TYPE EVERYTHING YOURSELF. Understand
    it. Break it. Fix it. Ask creative questions and then modify your
    code to answer them.
