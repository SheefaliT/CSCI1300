Basic Functions (C++)
======

This is the C++ version of the basic functions homework
assignment. Get all the files in this directory and put them
somewhere. You should consider using git (`git pull` if you already
have cloned the repository).

Edit _only_ the `basic_functions.cpp` file. This is the only file you
need to turn in.

To build and run, just execute the make process, then run
`basic_functions_test`. Like this:

	cd directory_to_where_you_put_the_files/
	make
	./basic_functions_test

Happy hacking!
