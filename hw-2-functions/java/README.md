Basic Functions (Java)
========

Download the files in this directory, and edit _only_ BasicFunctions.java.

To compile from the command line, `cd` into the directory and compile
with `javac`, and then run the testing file with `java`. You have to
have junit.jar and the current working directory in your
classpath. Here are those commands spelled out:


	cd cs1300/homeworks/hw-2-basic-functions/java
	javac -classpath junit.jar:. *.java
	java -classpath junit.jar:. BasicFunctionsTest
