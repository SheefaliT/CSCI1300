Slug Race! (Java version)
========

The slugs can even race in Java.

Edit and turn in `Slug.java`. That file is already started for
you. You should fill in the `next_round` method so it looks at the
slug's current hunger and energy levels, and return one of the
appropriate values in the `Decision` enumeration:

* Decision.MOVE
* Decision.EAT
* Decision.REST

How to compile and run the Slug Race
---------

Compile like normal:

	javac *.java
	
And run the `Race` class:

	java Race
